# Brick-Breaking-Game

> This project is a classic brick breaking arcade game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

> The game uses an HTML5 Canvas to render the ball, paddle, and bricks dynamically. 

> JavaScript handles the game logic, including ball movement, collision detection, and scoring.

> CSS is used to style the game layout and improve the visual appearance of the interface. 

> The player controls the paddle using keyboard arrow keys or mouse movement.

> The ball bounces off walls, the paddle, and bricks based on real-time collision calculations.

> Each brick broken increases the player’s score and removes the brick from the canvas.

> The game ends when all bricks are destroyed or the ball falls below the paddle.
